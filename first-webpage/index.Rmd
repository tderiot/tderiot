Hi, I'm Tanguy Deriot.

I'm a fourth year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying Geography with an emphasis in GIS. I hope to use the knowledge I learned during my time in university to increase my skills in software and get a career in urban/city planning, I am especially interested in public transportation in urban environments.
